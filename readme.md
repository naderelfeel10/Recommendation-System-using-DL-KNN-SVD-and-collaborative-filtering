Movie Recommender System! ðŸŽ¬

Iâ€™ve been building a personalized movie recommendation platform using Python, TensorFlow, SVD ,KNN and Streamlit. This project combines multiple approaches to suggest movies to users:

Techniques I used in this Project:

Cold Start -- Top-rated movies (Bayesian Average) for new users.
Collaborative Filtering :
 1. User-Based CF -- Recommends movies based on similar user preferences.
 2. Item-Based CF -- Recommends movies based on user history preferences.
Matrix Factorization :
 1. using Tensorflow (keras) -- Predicts personalized ratings for each user.
 2. SVD -- dot product of 2 latent factors matrices 
Interactive UI with Streamlit -- Search, explore, and get recommendations 

Project Design :
 1. Well-structured project architecture for easy maintenance and scalability.
 2. OOP, and modular functions for each component.
 3. Logging implemented for evaluation and debugging.
 4. Clean separation of models, data loader, preprocessing, and UI.

Technologies & Tools:
 Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit, FuzzyWuzzy
